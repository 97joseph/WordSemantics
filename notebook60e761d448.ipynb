In other words, you will populate your `best_probs` and `best_paths` matrices.\n- Walk forward through the corpus.\n- For each word, compute a probability for each possible tag. \n- Unlike the previous algorithm `predict_pos` (the 'warm-up' exercise), this will include the path up to that (word,tag) combination. \n\nHere is an example with a three-word corpus \"Loss tracks upward\":\n- Note, in this example, only a subset of states (POS tags) are shown in the diagram below, for easier reading. \n- In the diagram below, the first word \"Loss\" is already initialized. \n- The algorithm will compute a probability for each of the potential tags in the second and future words. \n\nCompute the probability that the tag of the second work ('tracks') is a verb, 3rd person singular present (VBZ).  \n- In the `best_probs` matrix, go to the column of the second word ('tracks'), and row 40 (VBZ), this cell is highlighted in light orange in the diagram below.\n- Examine each of the paths from the tags of the first word ('Loss') and choose the most likely path.  \n- An example of the calculation for **one** of those paths is the path from ('Loss', NN) to ('tracks', VBZ).\n- The log of the probability of the path up to and including the first word 'Loss' having POS tag NN is $-14.32$.  The `best_probs` matrix contains this value -14.32 in the column for 'Loss' and row for 'NN'.\n- Find the probability that NN transitions to VBZ.  To find this probability, go to the `A` transition matrix, and go to the row for 'NN' and the column for 'VBZ'.  The value is $4.37e-02$, which is circled in the diagram, so add $-14.32 + log(4.37e-02)$. \n- Find the log of the probability that the tag VBS would 'emit' the word 'tracks'.  To find this, look at the 'B' emission matrix in row 'VBZ' and the column for the word 'tracks'.  The value $4.61e-04$ is circled in the diagram below.  So add $-14.32 + log(4.37e-02) + log(4.61e-04)$.\n- The sum of $-14.32 + log(4.37e-02) + log(4.61e-04)$ is $-25.13$. Store $-25.13$ in the `best_probs` matrix at row 'VBZ' and column 'tracks' (as seen in the cell that is highlighted in light orange in the diagram).\n- All other paths in best_probs are calculated.  Notice that $-25.13$ is greater than all of the other values in column 'tracks' of matrix `best_probs`, and so the most likely path to 'VBZ' is from 'NN'.  'NN' is in row 20 of the `best_probs` matrix, so $20$ is the most likely path.\n- Store the most likely path $20$ in the `best_paths` table.

Recall that this example corpus has three words: \"Loss tracks upward\".\n\nPOS tag for 'upward' is `RB`\n- Select the the most likely POS tag for the last word in the corpus, 'upward' in the `best_prob` table.\n- Look for the row in the column for 'upward' that has the largest probability.\n- Notice that in row 28 of `best_probs`, the estimated probability is -34.99, which is larger than the other values in the column.  So the most likely POS tag for 'upward' is `RB` an adverb, at row 28 of `best_prob`. \n- The variable `z` is an array that stores the unique integer ID of the predicted POS tags for each word in the corpus.  In array z, at position 2, store the value 28 to indicate that the word 'upward' (at index 2 in the corpus), most likely has the POS tag associated with unique ID 28 (which is `RB`).\n- The variable `pred` contains the POS tags in string form.

The value stored in `best_paths`, column 2, row 28 indicates the unique ID of the POS tag of the previous word.  In this case, the value stored here is 40, which is the unique ID for POS tag `VBZ` (verb, 3rd person singular present).\n- So the previous word at index 1 of the corpus ('tracks'), most likely has the POS tag with unique ID 40, which is `VBZ`.\n- In array `z`, store the value 40 at position 1, and for array `pred`, store the string `VBZ` to indicate that the word 'tracks' most likely has POS tag `VBZ`.\n\nPOS tag for 'Loss' is `NN`\n- In `best_paths` at column 1, the unique ID stored at row 40 is 20.  20 is the unique ID for POS tag `NN`.\n- In array `z` at position 0, store 20.

What is the difference between Count Vectorizer, TFIDF, Word2Vec and GloVe Vectors? *\n \n One of the major challenges that any NLP Data Scientist faces is to choose the best possible numerical/vectorial representation of the text strings for running Machine Learning models. In a general scenario, we work on a bunch of text information that may or may not be tagged and we then want to build a ML model that can understand the pattern based on the words present in the strings to predict a new text data.\n\nFor example, we know that \"Its raining heavily outside\" and \"Its pouring down outside\" mean the same thing. But how to make the computer understand it. As far as we know, computers can only understand numerical data, while natural language data, for computers, are just text strings without any numerical or statistical information.\n\nSo how to bridge the gap? How to make computers understand text data?\n\nBy converting texts to numbers and also conserving linguistic information for analysis.\n\nIn this article i am going to discuss about 2 different ways of converting Text to Numbers for analysis.\n\nCount Vectorizers:\nCount Vectorizer is a way to convert a given set of strings into a frequency representation.\n\nLets take this example:\n\nText1 = “Natural Language Processing is a subfield of AI”\ntag1 = \"NLP\"\n\nText2 = “Computer Vision is a subfield of AI”\ntag2 = \"CV\"\n\nIn the above two examples you have Texts that are Tagged respectively. This is a very simple case of NLP where you get tagged text data set and then using it you have to predict the tag of another text data.\n\nThe above two texts can be converted into count frequency using the CountVectorizer function of sklearn library:\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer as CV\nimport pandas as pd\ncv = CV()\ncv.fit([Text1, Text2])\nx= cv.transform([Text1]).toarray()\ny= cv.transform([Text2]).toarray()\ncolumns = cv.get_feature_names()\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(x, columns= columns, index= [\"Text1\"])\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(y, columns= columns, index= [\"Text2\"])\ndf = pd.concat([df1,df2])\ndf[\"tag\"] = [\"NLP\", \"CV\"]\ndf\n\nNo alt text provided for this image\nSince Text1 doesn't contain words \"computer\" and \"vision\", hence their frequencies are calculated as 0 while other words are present once hence their frequencies are equal to 1.\n\nThis is, in a nutshell, how we use Count Vectorizer!\n\nCount Vectors can be helpful in understanding the type of text by the frequency of words in it. But its major disadvantages are:\n\nIts inability in identifying more important and less important words for analysis.\nIt will just consider words that are abundant in a corpus as the most statistically significant word.\nIt also doesn't identify the relationships between words such as linguistic similarity between words.\nTF-IDF:\nTF-IDF means Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency. This is a statistic that is based on the frequency of a word in the corpus but it also provides a numerical representation of how important a word is for statistical analysis.\n\nTF-IDF is better than Count Vectorizers because it not only focuses on the frequency of words present in the corpus but also provides the importance of the words. We can then remove the words that are less important for analysis, hence making the model building less complex by reducing the input dimensions.\n\nThis is how tf-idf is calculated:\n\nNo alt text provided for this image\nThe term \"tf\" is basically the count of a word in a sentence. for example, in the above two examples for Text1, the tf value of the word \"subfield\" will be 1.\n\nthe term \"df\" is called document frequency which means in how many documents the word \"subfield\" is present within corpus. In our case the corpus consists of Text1 and Text2 (N value is 2) and the word \"subfield\" is present in both. Hence its df value is 2.\n\nAlso since in the formula df is present in the denominator of log (N/df) its called inverse document frequency. Hence the name tf-idf.\n\nHere is how we calculate tfidf for a corpus:\n\nText1 = “Natural Language Processing is a subfield of AI”\ntag1 = \"NLP\"\n\nText2 = “Computer Vision is a subfield of AI”\ntag2 = \"CV\"\n\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer as tf_idf\nimport pandas as pd\ntfidf = tf_idf(norm = None)\ntfidf.fit([Text1, Text2])\nx= tfidf.transform([Text1]).toarray()\ny= tfidf.transform([Text2]).toarray()\ncolumns = tfidf.get_feature_names()\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(x, columns= columns, index= [\"Text1\"])\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(y, columns= columns, index= [\"Text2\"])\ndf = pd.concat([df1,df2])\ndf[\"tag\"] = [\"NLP\", \"CV\"]\ndf\n\nNo alt text provided for this image\nHere sklearn calculated the idf value as:\n\nidf = ln[(1+N)/(1+df)]+1\nFor Text1 the calculation is:\n\nIn our example since there are only 2 texts/documents in the corpus, hence N=2\n\nNo alt text provided for this image\nImportance of Words:\n\nTFIDF is based on the logic that words that are too abundant in a corpus and words that are too rare are both not statistically important for finding a pattern. The Logarithmic factor in tfidf mathematically penalizes the words that are too abundant or too rare in the corpus by giving them low tfidf scores.\n\nHigher value of tfidf signifies higher importance of the words in the corpus while lower values represent lower importance. In the above example the word \"AI\" is present in both the sentences while words \"Natural\" and \"Computer\" are present only in one sentences each. Hence the tfidf value of \"AI\" is lower than the other two. While for the word \"Natural\" there are more words in Text1 hence its importance is lower than \"Computer\" since there are less number of words in Text2.\n\nEven though TFIDF can provide a good understanding about the importance of words but just like Count Vectors, its disadvantage is:\n\nIt fails to provide linguistic information about the words such as the real meaning of the words, similarity with other words etc.\nTo train a model on the actual linguistic relationship of the words, there are two other word embedding techniques widely used in NLP, they are \"word2vec\" and \"Glove\". I will discuss about these two in another articl\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" Q2.
